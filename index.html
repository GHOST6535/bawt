    <h1>Classroom Section</h1>

    <p>Halt.</p>
    <p>(Make sure to stop outside the classroom)</p>
    <p>When you enter the classroom full capital letters like we were doing outside will no longer be in effect.</p>
    <p>You may now enter the classroom and sit down, make sure to fill the front rows first (Once you’ve said this right, dress and back up)</p>
    <p>We are now on the classroom section.</p>
    <p>The classroom rules will now be said. Any and all rules previously mentioned will still apply to the classroom.</p>
    <p>No cheating on the quiz section, being caught doing so will automatically dismiss you.</p>
    <p>This includes saying the answer out loud, or attempting to google answers.</p>
    <p>Am I understood?</p>
    <p>In this classroom we will be going over the following things, the Chain of Command, Uniform regulations, & Regiments / Dizzy.</p>

    <h2>Section 1: The Chain Of Command.</h2>
    <p>The chain of command is a structure where you have the person with the most authority at the top and least authority at the bottom.</p>
    <p>To follow the chain of command you must start off with the lowest available person at the bottom of the chain of command and contact them with your issue.</p>
    <p>If they are unable to fix your problem or don’t respond within 12 hours you can move up to the next person in the chain of command.</p>
    <p>You repeat this process until your issue is solved.</p>

    <h2>Section 2: Uniform Regulations.</h2>
    <p>You need to be wearing the correct uniform for the correct time, in events you need to be wearing PT uniform and when you aren't a standard uniform.</p>
    <p>You need to be wearing a realistic skin tone and must not be wearing a package.</p>
    <p>OF-2+ are the only ranks able to wear Formals.</p>

    <h2>Section 3: Regiments / Dizzy.</h2>
    <p>You need to be in the dizzy to be able to join a regiment, to progress faster and rank up more you need to join a regiment.</p>
    <p>You are able to gain perks by joining regiments, for example, ETS can train recruits and RMP can guard the gate with guns.</p>

    <h1>Quiz Section / Graduation</h1>

    <p>Now that I have gone over everything, it's time for a quiz. Hope you were paying attention.</p>
    <p>I will send the question in game, and do not answer until the countdown ends.</p>
    <p>If you answer before the countdown ends it will be considered cheating and you will be dismissed.</p>
    <p>If you take too long after the countdown ends to respond it will not count.</p>
    <p>Question 1: What is the chain of command?:cd 60 Question 2: How many hours before you can move up in the chain of command?:cd 30 Question 3: Which ranks may wear formal uniforms?:cd 30 Question 4: What are the advantages of joining a regiment?:cd 60 Question: 5: In an event, what uniform must you wear?:cd 30Good job on the quiz everyone, I will now be tallying everyone’s scores up.</p>
    <p>I will now announce who has passed, if you failed you can always try again another time!</p>
    <p>If you end up back in spawn, you did not pass.</p>
    <p>(promote them in this part)</p>
    <p>Congratulations, You have performed exceptionally throughout this training and will be promoted in due course.</p>
    <p>The promotion will not happen instantly, so please be patient.Squad,Wedge, On me.Squad,Present, Arms.</p>
