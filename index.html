    <h1>Classroom Section</h1>

    <p>Halt. [cite: 87]</p>
    <p>(Make sure to stop outside the classroom) [cite: 87]</p>
    <p>When you enter the classroom full capital letters like we were doing outside will no longer be in effect. [cite: 87, 88]</p>
    <p>You may now enter the classroom and sit down, make sure to fill the front rows first (Once you’ve said this right, dress and back up) [cite: 88]</p>
    <p>We are now on the classroom section. [cite: 88, 89]</p>
    <p>The classroom rules will now be said. Any and all rules previously mentioned will still apply to the classroom. [cite: 89, 90]</p>
    <p>No cheating on the quiz section, being caught doing so will automatically dismiss you. [cite: 90, 91]</p>
    <p>This includes saying the answer out loud, or attempting to google answers. [cite: 91, 92]</p>
    <p>Am I understood? [cite: 92]</p>
    <p>In this classroom we will be going over the following things, the Chain of Command, Uniform regulations, & Regiments / Dizzy. [cite: 92, 93]</p>

    <h2>Section 1: The Chain Of Command. [cite: 93]</h2>
    <p>The chain of command is a structure where you have the person with the most authority at the top and least authority at the bottom. [cite: 93, 94]</p>
    <p>To follow the chain of command you must start off with the lowest available person at the bottom of the chain of command and contact them with your issue. [cite: 94, 95]</p>
    <p>If they are unable to fix your problem or don’t respond within 12 hours you can move up to the next person in the chain of command. [cite: 95, 96]</p>
    <p>You repeat this process until your issue is solved. [cite: 96, 97]</p>

    <h2>Section 2: Uniform Regulations. [cite: 97]</h2>
    <p>You need to be wearing the correct uniform for the correct time, in events you need to be wearing PT uniform and when you aren't a standard uniform. [cite: 97, 98]</p>
    <p>You need to be wearing a realistic skin tone and must not be wearing a package. [cite: 98, 99]</p>
    <p>OF-2+ are the only ranks able to wear Formals. [cite: 99, 100]</p>

    <h2>Section 3: Regiments / Dizzy. [cite: 100]</h2>
    <p>You need to be in the dizzy to be able to join a regiment, to progress faster and rank up more you need to join a regiment. [cite: 100, 101]</p>
    <p>You are able to gain perks by joining regiments, for example, ETS can train recruits and RMP can guard the gate with guns. [cite: 101, 102]</p>

    <h1>Quiz Section / Graduation [cite: 102]</h1>

    <p>Now that I have gone over everything, it's time for a quiz. Hope you were paying attention. [cite: 102, 103]</p>
    <p>I will send the question in game, and do not answer until the countdown ends. [cite: 103, 104]</p>
    <p>If you answer before the countdown ends it will be considered cheating and you will be dismissed. [cite: 104, 105]</p>
    <p>If you take too long after the countdown ends to respond it will not count. [cite: 105, 106]</p>
    <p>Question 1: What is the chain of command?:cd 60 Question 2: How many hours before you can move up in the chain of command?:cd 30 Question 3: Which ranks may wear formal uniforms?:cd 30 Question 4: What are the advantages of joining a regiment?:cd 60 Question: 5: In an event, what uniform must you wear?:cd 30Good job on the quiz everyone, I will now be tallying everyone’s scores up. [cite: 106, 107]</p>
    <p>I will now announce who has passed, if you failed you can always try again another time! [cite: 107, 108]</p>
    <p>If you end up back in spawn, you did not pass. [cite: 108, 109]</p>
    <p>(promote them in this part) [cite: 109, 110]</p>
    <p>Congratulations, You have performed exceptionally throughout this training and will be promoted in due course. [cite: 110]</p>
    <p>The promotion will not happen instantly, so please be patient.Squad,Wedge, On me.Squad,Present, Arms. [cite: 110]</p>
