<h1>Classroom Section</h1>

<p>Halt. [cite: 31, 32]</p>
<p>(Make sure to stop outside the classroom) [cite: 32]</p>
<p>When you enter the classroom full capital letters like we were doing outside will no longer be in effect. [cite: 32, 33]</p>
<p>You may now enter the classroom and sit down, make sure to fill the front rows first (Once you’ve said this right, dress and back up) [cite: 33]</p>
<p>We are now on the classroom section. [cite: 33, 34]</p>
<p>The classroom rules will now be said. Any and all rules previously mentioned will still apply to the classroom. [cite: 34]</p>
<p>No cheating on the quiz section, being caught doing so will automatically dismiss you. [cite: 35]</p>
<p>This includes saying the answer out loud, or attempting to google answers. [cite: 36]</p>
<p>Am I understood? [cite: 36, 37]</p>
<p>In this classroom we will be going over the following things, the Chain of Command, Uniform regulations, & Regiments / Dizzy. [cite: 37, 38]</p>

<h2>Section 1: The Chain Of Command.</h2>
<p>The chain of command is a structure where you have the person with the most authority at the top and least authority at the bottom. [cite: 38, 39]</p>
<p>To follow the chain of command you must start off with the lowest available person at the bottom of the chain of command and contact them with your issue. [cite: 39, 40]</p>
<p>If they are unable to fix your problem or don’t respond within 12 hours you can move up to the next person in the chain of command. [cite: 40, 41]</p>
<p>You repeat this process until your issue is solved. [cite: 41]</p>

<h2>Section 2: Uniform Regulations.</h2>
<p>You need to be wearing the correct uniform for the correct time, in events you need to be wearing PT uniform and when you aren't a standard uniform. [cite: 41, 42]</p>
<p>You need to be wearing a realistic skin tone and must not be wearing a package. [cite: 43, 44]</p>
<p>OF-2+ are the only ranks able to wear Formals. [cite: 44]</p>

<h2>Section 3: Regiments / Dizzy.</h2>
<p>You need to be in the dizzy to be able to join a regiment, to progress faster and rank up more you need to join a regiment. [cite: 45, 46]</p>
<p>You are able to gain perks by joining regiments, for example, ETS can train recruits and RMP can guard the gate with guns. [cite: 46, 47]</p>

<h1>Quiz Section / Graduation</h1>

<p>Now that I have gone over everything, it's time for a quiz. Hope you were paying attention. [cite: 47, 48]</p>
<p>I will send the question in game, and do not answer until the countdown ends. [cite: 48, 49]</p>
<p>If you answer before the countdown ends it will be considered cheating and you will be dismissed. [cite: 49, 50]</p>
<p>If you take too long after the countdown ends to respond it will not count. [cite: 50, 51]</p>
<p>Question 1: What is the chain of command?:cd 60 Question 2: How many hours before you can move up in the chain of command?:cd 30 Question 3: Which ranks may wear formal uniforms?:cd 30 Question 4: What are the advantages of joining a regiment?:cd 60 Question: 5: In an event, what uniform must you wear?:cd 30Good job on the quiz everyone, I will now be tallying everyone’s scores up. [cite: 51]</p>
<p>I will now announce who has passed, if you failed you can always try again another time! [cite: 52, 53]</p>
<p>If you end up back in spawn, you did not pass. [cite: 53, 54]</p>
<p>(promote them in this part) [cite: 54]</p>
